In this project, I designed a website for booking campsites around CANADA. Users can register an account, create a new campsite, and add feedback for an existing campsite.

## Backend: <br />

• Apply Express to create the full-stack JS application <br />
• Use MongoDB to save campsite information

## Frontend: <br />

• Utilize Native JavaScript, HTML5 <br />
• Use CSS Frameworks including Bootstrap 5, Semantic UI, and Bulma

## Develop: <br />

• Leverage Postman to monitor and test APIs

(Note: it could take around 30s to open the application for the first time because the website is put to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity)
