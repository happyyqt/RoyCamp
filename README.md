In this project, I designed a website for booking campsites around CANADA. Users can register an account, create a new campsite, and add feedback for an existing campsite.

## Backend: <br />
• Apply Express to create full-stack JS applications
• Use MongoDB to save campsite information

## Frontend: <br />
• Utilize Native JavaScript, HTML5
• Use CSS Frameworks including Bootstrap 5, Semantic UI, and Bulma

## Develop: <br />
• Leverage Postman to monitor and test APIs
